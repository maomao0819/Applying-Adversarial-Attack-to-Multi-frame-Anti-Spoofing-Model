# Action Learning
## About
Action Learning is an intermediary website that uses machine learning to figure out human's movement.
- Its layout was adjusted to be more convenient in term of the developer purpose.
- Action Learning is attached with WebSocket to use for player movement in Garbage Collector Game.

It was made under BeesightSoft internship duration and is referenced from [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
The experiment is built using the [deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) library.


### Edit server
```
GOTO:
..\jsTensorflow\src\outputs\DirectionOutput and change your websocket URL.
	EX:	var wsURL ='ws://192.168.1.2:9000';
```
#### Build project
```
yarn build
```
#### Start local server by running 
```
node index.js
```
### Access server
- Go to localhost:3000 to see your complete build. 
- The DirectionOutput acts as a client and send the 'order' to server.

RECOMMENDED: Each order should be trained with 10 or more samples so that the output will give the best result.<br/>

# GarbageCollector
### Run WebGL Game Version

In the project folder
download http-server (assume that you already have npm)
```
npm i http-server
```
### Access the game's server
```
http-server
```
Go to one of the IP listed in the console and the game should be loaded.
### How To Play Game
1) Casual mode <br/>
Use left and right arrow on keyboard to play.
2) Hardcore mode <br/>
Choose Settings and Enter the Websocket IP the same with one in the DirectionOutput.js client.   
After training completely 3 directions from jsTensorflow. You can use your movement to give order for the car movement.
